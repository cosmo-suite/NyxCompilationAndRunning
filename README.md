# Running Nyx simulations on Perlmutter and Frontier

This repositories contains the details of how to run Nyx simulations. Here are 
what the individual directories contain

1. `CosmicIC` - generating initial conditions for the dark matter particles. Required by all simulations.
2. `Gimlet` - post processing Nyx data
3. `HaloFinder` - writing lightcones and halos for dark matter simulations
4. `LyA` - Lyman alpha forest simulations.

These are not end-to-end details. But inputs, makefiles and scripts on Perlmutter and Frontier.
